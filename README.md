# Top-Colleges-List-in-India---Project

This project's dataset came from Kaggle, a well-known website for data science competitions and data analysis. The dataset included facts on the courses offered, costs, and placement ratings for numerous institutions in India. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using a variety of methods, such as addressing missing values, deleting duplicates, and changing data types as appropriate, in order to undertake exploratory data analysis. The data might now be used to derive more insightful conclusions thanks to this procedure. The analysis addressed a number of significant dataset-related issues, such as the average fees and placement scores by state, the variation in placement scores between streams and etc. Pandas, a well-known Python data manipulation toolkit, was used to get the answers to these queries. To aid in the comprehension of the data, visualisations were made using the Matplotlib and Seaborn tools. Bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots were some of the visualizations that were used to assist in finding patterns and trends in the data.
